# PassTheTraps
Our game features a stylish and charismatic character on an exciting adventure. As the player, you take control of this hero and navigate through a world full of challenges and dangers.

There are moving platforms that require precise timing and careful jumps. A single mistake can send you falling.

You'll encounter dangerous enemies and obstacles. If you're not fast enough, they’ll push you off the edge.

There are spinning platforms inspired by "rotating dummies" — you'll have to time your moves to cross them safely.

Small sweepers appear along the way, trying to push you off course and slow your progress.

After overcoming all the challenges, you finally reach your goal — a mysterious temple, where something valuable might be waiting to be stolen...

While playing this game, you’ll learn:

Quick reflexes and timing

Strategic thinking and path planning

Patience and perseverance in the face of obstacles
