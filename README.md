## 🕹️ About the Game

You play as a charismatic adventurer traversing a dangerous and ever-changing environment. From shifting ground to spinning traps, each step demands precision and focus.

- ⚠️ **Moving Platforms:** Jump across unstable platforms that require sharp reflexes and perfect timing. One misstep, and you're falling into the abyss.
  
- 🔩 **Spinning Traps:** Inspired by "rotating dummies," these moving hazards require patience and well-timed movement to pass through safely.
  
- 💥 **Enemies & Obstacles:** Unforgiving foes and cleverly placed traps will push you off balance — or off the edge — if you're not fast enough.
  
- 🧹 **Sweepers:** These small, persistent machines will do everything to shove you off the path. Avoid or outmaneuver them to keep moving forward.
  
- 🏛️ **Final Challenge:** Reach the mysterious temple that hides a valuable treasure… if you manage to survive the gauntlet!
